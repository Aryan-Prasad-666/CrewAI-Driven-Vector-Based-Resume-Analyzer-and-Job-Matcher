Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Mechanical Design Engineer - CREO position at HCLTech, as advertised on LinkedIn. With my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and experience at HCL Technologies as a Quality Assurance and Documentation Engineer, I am confident I possess the skills and experience necessary to excel in this role and contribute significantly to your team. My proficiency in CREO Parametric, coupled with my understanding of engineering change orders, design specifications, and BOMs, aligns perfectly with the requirements outlined in the job description.

During my time at HCL Technologies, I was responsible for managing engineering change orders, verifying technical documentation, and participating in design reviews. This experience has provided me with a strong foundation in mechanical design principles and practices, as well as a deep understanding of the importance of quality assurance and compliance with industry standards. Furthermore, my final year project, which involved the design and fabrication of a test rig for Nano fluids, demonstrates my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical engineering challenges.

I am eager to leverage my skills and experience to contribute to HCLTech's success. Thank you for your time and consideration. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,
Prerana A. M.
